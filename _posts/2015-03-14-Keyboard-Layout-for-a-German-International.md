title: Keyboard Layout for a German International
---

As you might know, I'm a German in India.
And my everyday language is English.
But sometimes, I get mail from my friends in Germany, in German, and some of them prefer if I reply to them in German, not in English.

The problem with that is that I don't like switching keyboard layout, and that I don't like the German keyboard layout.
The German keyboard layout puts `[]{}` in strange places and thus is much less comfortable for programming.
But the English keyboard layout doesn't provide the German characters `äöüÄÖÜß` and `€`.

Today, I discovered a nice solution for that in KDE.
There is a keyboard layout which is the English layout but allows easy typing of all these German characters.
It can be easily configured in this way:
- Go to start menu, open *System Settings*
- In section *Hardware*, open *Input Devices*
- In section *Keyboard*, go to tab *Layouts*
- There, enable *Configure layouts*, and *Add* the layout *EurKEY (US based layout with european letters)*. It can also be found under language *German, Swiss*.

The keys can be typed as follows:

|-----------+--------------:|
| character |     keystroke |
|-----------+--------------:|
| ä         |       `alt A` |
| Ä         | `alt shift A` |
| ö         |       `alt O` |
| Ö         | `alt shift O` |
| ü         |       `alt U` |
| Ü         | `alt shift U` |
| ß         |       `alt S` |
| €         |       `alt 5` |
|-----------+--------------:|

Here's the sequence in pictures:
